                <p>Learning to unlearn means something that I have learned already,try to forget it often because it was wrong or it was having bad influence on us. At first if we want to learn something new we have to let it go with what I have learned in the past or some practice that was having bad influence on us.we have to start freshly so that we can absorb that knowledge properly.Unlearning is the process of realising that something which we learnt earlier is incorrect, ineffective, or obsolete, admitting it and deciding to erase such bad conditioning and misconceptions from our mind for good. It is the process of exploring what we have stored in our system and deleting all the unnecessary data. It is the process of saying bye to an old, obsolete, and outdated paradigm, and embracing a new paradigm and willingly undergoing a paradigm shift.

                    Unfortunately, we are controlled by myths which do not allow us to open our eyes to reality.</p>

                <p>The future potential of AI and machine learning in Python is enormous. These two fields have grown quickly in recent years and will be the most important in the future.
                    The most in-demand job roles in this field are growing at a rapid pace. Professionals in AI and machine learning can find work all across the world.
                    Python is platform Independent and is hence one of the most flexible and popular choices for use across different platforms and technologies with the least tweaks in basic coding.</p>

                <p>Robotics, computer vision, language detection, game playing, expert systems, speech recognition, and many other fields have opportunities for machine development.
                    There are many features of python for AI
                    • Facial Recognition
                    • Data Ingestion
                    • Quantum Computing
                    • Deep learning
                    • Automate Tasks
                    • Cloud Computing
                    • Chatbots etc.
                    AI and machine learning are used to do the majority of human work. We can utilize them to construct machines that can solve human issues on their own, without the need for human intervention.
                    Python is a simple language to learn and is widely recognized as the best programming language in these sectors since it is straightforward to code and has pre-built libraries that make writing code faster and easier.</p>

                <p>we love our life on the internet, be finding interesting content online ,connecting with people through social media apps saying that with loved ones or just binging our favorite shows
                    but what if i were to tell you that you could actually have a life in the internet this is the metaverse  the 3d Internet of the future.</p>
